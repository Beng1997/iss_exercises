1.	In most of the programs written, we recycled most of the code lines in the main function, specifically the lines regarding the reading and checking the viability of the input file.
Moreover we called a few times for histogram in order to make different calculations in which we think that there might be a way to unify them by changing the conditions of the questions.
2.	The command uses the library randon and then generates 2 random bytes, convert them into and integer from 0 to 2^16-1 and then uses mod100 on the integer to calculate the reminder from 100. because the command randomaly picks 2 bytes the distribution of the grades is equally and uniformed distributed
